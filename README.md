# Bumper Car Racing Game

This game was made by me for a game development class that I took while I was abroad, which I continued to devlop on afterwards.

# Description

The game is a 3D racing game made with Unity. It includes features such as AI players to race against, an easy and a hard mode, additional physics to simulate a bumper car feel, as well as various effects to spice the game up. All artwork was either used from the Unity Standard Assets Pack or taken from OpenGameArt.org.

# How to Play

Simply clone the repository to your computer and go to the folder where the repository is. Then navigate into the folder for your operating system (i.e. go into the windows_build folder if you run windows) and run the executable. You should be good to go! Enjoy.
